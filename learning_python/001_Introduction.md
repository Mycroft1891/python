# Introduction

```python
from MODULE import FUNCTION
```

We can use this syntax to import a function from a module. A module a collection
of functions. The python language comes iwth the **standard library** which
provides a lot of resusable code. The standard lbirary is a collection of
modules each containing various functions. Some of the most common standard
library modules are:

- sys: system realted attributes
- os: interact with the operating system
- datetime: work with dates
- time: display and format time strings
- html: parse html escape and manipulate

## Data Structures

Python comes with built in data structures such as lists which are the
equivalent of arrays in other languages and can hold data of any type. Varibles
in Python are dynamically typed. They take the type from the object it is
assigned to. We can use **dot notation** to access nested attributes and
methods.

## Indentation

In python, every block of code (suite) is indented rather than delimitered with
parenthesis. A colon (:) introduces a new suite thus a new level of indentation
is required. Each suite can have neste suites each with a new level of
indentation.
