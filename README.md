# My Python projects

Python projects are seperated into folders:

1. django
2. games
  1. snakeGame.py (retro snake game using pygame)
3. scripts
  1. primeNumber.py (calculate all prime numbers)
To work with pipenv create a new folder

mkdir something-new
cd something-new

now install what you need with pipenv:

pipenv install django

this creates a pipfile and and lock file.

To create a local shell run:

pipenv shell

finally to exit the shell just type 'exit'
